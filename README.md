The goal of this project is to build an efficient Tic Tac Toe game. This app has a text view,
nine buttons corresponding to the tic tac toe game buttons and Action Bar.In the action bar, two items are
found: Reset and Colors. The reset buttons clears all entries and set the color for the entries to
be black. The Colors item allows the player to set a color for the Symbol being played next. Toasts
will pop up throughout the game and display the color changes, the winner or a tie.
